      Manipur has been witnessing sporadic violence ever since ethnic clashes
      broke out on May 3.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The death toll from clashes has gone up to over 80, officials said. <br />
      The ethnic violence first broke out after a ‘Tribal Solidarity March’ was
      organised in the hill districts on May 3 to protest the Meitei community’s
      demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. <br />
      The violence was preceded by tension over the eviction of Kuki villagers
      from reserve forest land, which had led to a series of smaller agitations.
